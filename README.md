[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KIllinPleaseWait/ArnoldRobot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KIllinPleaseWait/ArnoldRobot)

FRC robot code partially written in [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC). The source code for the terminators probably looks something like this.

## Building
You need to have WPILib installed and the [ArnoldC jar file](https://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC.jar) in the project's directory (in the same folder as this README file). Run `./build.sh`.
