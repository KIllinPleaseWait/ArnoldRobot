# ArnoldRobot

FRC robot code partially written in [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC). The source code for the terminators probably looks something like this.

## Building
You need to have WPILib installed and the [ArnoldC jar file](http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC.jar) in the project's directory (in the same folder as this README file). Run `./build.sh`.
